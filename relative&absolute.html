        <p>In this there is parent & child relation appears. For parent element use property relative and for child element use absolute to act as in referrence to parent element.
            Only absolute refer body as a parent and changes its position as reference to body parent.
        when we want the element to act as child of other element then we add relative proerty to parent and absolute to child. </p>
