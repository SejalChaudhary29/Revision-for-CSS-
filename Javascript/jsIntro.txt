Javasript is a browser specific  language which can handle user interaction .
Javascript has a unique way of interacting with HTML elements called as DOM manipulation.

DOM - Document Object model 
#document is a html  
#object is a representation of data with attributes with key and value pairs
#DOM is a object representation as HTML Elements.
Dom is a programming interface for web documents hat allows us to create, change or remove elements from the document.
//DOM example
<h1 style='color: gren'> Hey </h1>

{
    name: 'h1',
    style: '{
        color:red
        }',
    innerHTML:'Hey' 
}
why we needed a DOM: We needed dom to edit the element from JS insted of editing within the HTML element
